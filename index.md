Refactored Privacy Policy for Who is the Spy?
Last updated: [ april 16, 2025]
This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures regarding information when You use the Application and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.
"Who is the Spy?" is designed as an offline, local multiplayer game. The core functionality operates entirely on your device without requiring an internet connection. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices.
Interpretation and Definitions
Interpretation
The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.
Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:
Application refers to "Who is the Spy?", the software program provided by the Company.
Company (referred to as either "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to [Mahmoud Helmy].
Country refers to: Egypt
Device means any device that can access the Application such as a cellphone or a digital tablet.
Personal Data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. In the context of this Application, this is extremely limited as described below.
You means the individual accessing or using the Application, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Application, as applicable.
Collecting and Using Your Information
Types of Data Handled
Because the Application is designed for offline, local play, we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) automatically, such as your email address, phone number, location data, unique device identifiers (beyond what the operating system might use locally), contacts, or other sensitive personal data transmitted off the device.
The information handled by the Application is limited to data You provide or configure locally:
Optional Player Names: You may optionally enter names for players within a game session. This information is stored locally on the Device only for the duration of the current game session and is used solely to display player identities within that session. It is not transmitted off the Device and is not stored persistently after the game session ends or the Application is closed (except potentially temporarily as part of the Android activity's saved instance state if the app goes into the background). If You choose not to enter names, default identifiers (e.g., "Player 1") are used.
Game Configuration Settings: Information such as the selected number of players, number of spies, game time, and chosen category is entered by You. This data is used only to set up and manage the current game session locally. It is stored locally and temporarily on the Device and is not stored persistently after the game ends or the Application is closed (except potentially temporarily in saved instance state).
Language Preference: If You use the language toggle feature, your preferred language ("en" or "ar") is stored locally on your Device using Android's SharedPreferences. This is solely used to display the Application in your chosen language upon subsequent launches.
We explicitly DO NOT collect Usage Data such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (IP address), browser type, operating system details, unique device IDs transmitted to us, or information about your interaction with online services, as the Application functions offline.
Use of Your Information
The limited information handled by the Application is used exclusively for the following purposes:
To provide and maintain our Application: To configure and run the game locally on Your Device according to the settings You choose.
To manage the game session: To display player names (if entered) and manage game state locally.
To personalize your experience: To display the Application interface in your selected language preference.
Retention of Your Information
Player Names and Game Configuration Settings: This data is ephemeral and generally retained only for the duration of the active game session. It is discarded when the game ends or the Application is closed (subject to temporary storage in saved instance state by the Android system).
Language Preference: This preference is stored locally on Your Device until You change it within the Application or until the Application's data is cleared or the Application is uninstalled.
We do not retain Personal Data for longer than is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, primarily because the data handled is minimal and local.
Transfer of Your Information
No transfer of Your information will take place. Your information, including optional player names and settings, is processed and stored only locally on Your Device. It is not transferred to the Company's servers or any third-party servers, organizations, or countries because the Application operates offline.
Delete Your Information
Since the Application primarily handles temporary, local data (player names, game settings), this data is automatically discarded after each game session.
You have control over the locally stored information:
Optional Player Names: You can choose not to enter player names. Any names entered are temporary.
Language Preference: You can change your language preference within the Application. You can also clear the Application's stored data (including the language preference) through Your Device's system settings or by uninstalling the Application.
We do not maintain backend systems storing your Personal Data, so there is no account or server-side data for You or Us to delete regarding your use of this specific offline Application.
Disclosure of Your Information
Given the offline nature of the Application and the minimal, local data handling, disclosure of your information is highly unlikely.
Law enforcement: Under certain rare circumstances, the Company might be required to disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency) concerning the Application itself, but not typically concerning user data generated during offline play.
Other legal requirements: The Company would only disclose information if necessary to:
Comply with a legal obligation
Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company (related to the Application itself)
Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Application
Protect the personal safety of users or the public (in extremely limited circumstances related to the app's function)
Protect against legal liability
Security of Your Information
The security of the limited, local information handled by the Application relies primarily on the security measures of Your Device and its operating system. While We strive to use acceptable means to protect information locally, remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We do not transmit your game data over the internet, which inherently limits exposure risks.
Children's Privacy
Our Application is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). The Application operates offline, and any names entered are done so locally by the users present. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has used the Application, please be aware that data collection is minimal and local. Supervising device usage is recommended. If You believe any unintended data was somehow collected, please contact Us.
Links to Other Websites
Our Application does not contain links to other websites.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Application's Google Play Store listing.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on the Google Play Store listing page.
